Ok, some notes:

Starting out with SampleUnboundedQueue:
    Have to make a Node class to hold onto the linked list, but is it worth it 
to make an encompassing class? I say no for now, maybe it will be later. 

note: crap I made my test cases with numbers instead of Strings! Oh, just kidding
I just missed one spot where I didn't fix my original faulty int-based test case

ok that didn't work. What's wrong with my test cases? Ah, nothing. It's a
NullPointerException being caused by my add() method. 

Hmm. something's funky with my size() method. 

YESSSSSSSS passed all my tests!

SampleUnboundedStack:
    toString methods for stacks were in backwards order! DANG! fixed that, tests
passed.

On to array implementations! 
    
    BoundedQueue went without issue, really. I set it up so adding to the queue
is at the back of the array and removing comes from the front (has to be shifted)

    BoundedStack is structured so the top of the stack is at the open end of the
array, as is most logical, really. 

gaaaaah my toString()s are still messed up for the stacks....
