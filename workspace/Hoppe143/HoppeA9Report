Assignment 9 Report

Starting out: 
    writing pseudocode for the algorithms for checking completeness. 
First thing is checking region state, so the mapping of region number to top 
left square in region is the first step. Figured it out! 
column coordinate = columns * (region % rows)
row coordinate = rows * (region / rows)

My current plan is to add the ints in each region into a set as the basis of my 
comparison for duplicates. This lends itself well to reusability, so I will go
for the challenge assignment and make iterators for the types of region. Methods
for getting these iterators will be private, and they will be private inner 
classes of the SudokuModel class. They will be used in a private State method, 
checkState, which will be called by the getRowState, getColumnState, and 
getRegionState methods with the appropriate iterator getter in the checkState
call. 

In the iterator classes, there are private fields to hold onto the row/column/
region and the position in each one. 
Also put the row and column of the first position in a region as a private field
in the RegionIterator class.

Had a bit of trouble with indices for the iterators, cleared it up nicely! All 
finished!
