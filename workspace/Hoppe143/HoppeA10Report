Sudoku View Assignment

Planning notes for SudokuView: 
    Make it a subclass of SudokuBoard
    Give it fields for selectedRow, selectedColumn, and base (reference)
    Make it an observer of SudokuBase and repaint it each time it updates
    Make it override the paintComponent with the same things it did before, but
     with an additional drawing statement for the selected row/col
    Give it listener inner class for selecting the cell (gonna have to do some
        fancy math here to figure out where to draw the selected cell)
    
    This should be pretty easy. 
    
Implementation notes:
    Made copies of fields in the SudokuView and reinstantiated them b/c wanted 
to preserve encapsulation of SudokuBoard class and avoid protected fields. 

Observer stuff: The update method calls a repaint, and I overrode fixGivens and 
setValue in SudokuModel to call super methods and then notify observers. 

Mouse listener: Used a mouseAdapter inner class for SudokuView, and 
simply used integer division and the getPoint method to select cells.
