Assignment 8 Report

Notes:
    Started out with the javadoc part, easily done. Next, the shape rendering. I
chose to just do numbers, because my grandmother who loves sudoku will be here 
over the summer so I want her to be able to play it. Next is the SudokuBase part.
At this point, I think it will be simplest to simply have the graphics be laid 
out in one pane and have one large array of values. That way, there will be less
messing aroud with reference semantics. This is just my thought beforehand. 

YESS! Got all the numbers done without much issue. Just tedium and checking 
consistency.

On to the SudokuBoard class. 

Grabbed rows and columns from SudokuBase in the constructor and put them as 
fields.  Held onto the side length of the whole thing in a field for convenience

drawing the board by way of nested for loops. alternate grey using a boolean

Ah! A problem with the boolean, it doesn't flip right for even numbers of columns

Drawing the squares is the same, use a nested for loop.
